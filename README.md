# PWA Text Editor ![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description:

&nbsp; This app is a text editor that allows users to create and edit a text file. The app has a simple interface and features basic functionality. This app configures a Webpack development environment for a web application called "J.A.T.E". It sets up plugins that generate HTML and a manifest file, add CSS loaders and Babel, and inject a custom service worker to cache assets and pages for offline access.

&nbsp; One unique feature of this text editor is its ability to be installed as a progressive web app (PWA). This means that users can add the app to their device's home screen and access it like a native app. The app also includes a button that prompts users to install it as a PWA when it is launched in a browser. Overall, this text editor is a simple and user-friendly tool for creating and editing text files with the added convenience of being able to install it as a PWA.
